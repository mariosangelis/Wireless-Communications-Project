#### IEEE 802.11n Rate Adaptation in Ath9k Driver: Implementation of Novel Algorithms and Comparison with Minstrel Algorithm. 
> Our work is focused on implementing novel algorithms for Rate Adaptation based on Minstrel by modifying some of his functionalities. In this way, we could conclude on what the
Minstrelâ€™s vulnerabilities are and whether we could achieve an optimization. Our goal is to find out how fast our algorithms converge to an MCS rate in comparatively to Minstrel in difficult circumstances.
